<p><font size="5"><b>Multithreading - Understanding the pros and cons</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FFFFFF">One of the greatest problems of the
earlier Win16 environment was that an application could do only one thing at one
time (that is &quot;single thread&quot;). However with the advent of Windows NT
3.5x, this changed. In 1995, with the release of Windows 95 this ultra powerful
technique came to be used in the common PC.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FFFFFF">So what is the use of Multithreading ?
- Consider Microsoft Word 97 or higher. It checks spelling while you type ! It
does it by multithreading - i.e running two &quot;threads&quot; (in layman's
language a &quot;thread&quot; is nothing but a&nbsp; piece of code, a sub or
function running simultaneously with the main program). In VB 5, a new function
AddressOf was introduced that enabled VB programmers to get the address of any
public function in a standard module. This enabled developers to use the
CreateThread API to create raw Win32 threads. Though this was effective in VB
5.0, with VB 6.0 it crashes miserably !</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Even at planet-source-code.com, I came across a
multithreading demo using the CreateThread API. Though <i>THE PROGRAM</i> works
with VB 6, <i>it is VERY unstable. Also For ... Next loops, Msgbox..., Open ..
etc statements do NOT work in the multithreaded procedures!</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Does this mean we cannot multithread safely !? Does
it mean that we have to worry about a message as shown above appearing ?</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Answer is a BIG NO !</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Multithreading is VERY easy once you master the
concepts... So just have a look at the sample code.. You will understand just
how easy it is to perform true and safe multithreading in VB !</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you gained any information, or if this article is
useful to you, a vote of yours will be appreciated. If you found it useless....
just DELETE it !</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Multithreading In VB 6 - The Safe Way</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The trick to effective and safe multithreading in VB
is to use the ActiveX EXE project type (set to standalone EXE). The trick here
is to create a new object on a new thread by calling the CreateObject() function
and to create the Form that you want to be multithreaded from within this
object. As a reult the form is created on a new thread, both of them can run
almost independently of the other ! The only problem is managing the code re-enterancy
- VB calls the Sub main() procedure every time a new object is created - we must
find whether the main window is shown or not - if not we must initialize it.
This method is actually very easy ! Just check out the sample code and I am sure
that you will be Multithreading right away</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">What's more - this code now even supports inter-thread
communication !</font></p>
